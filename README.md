## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** Next.js 16 (App Router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4
- **Auth:** NextAuth.js v5 (Google OAuth) for humans; `AGENT_API_KEY` bearer token for machines/agents
- **APIs:** 
  - Shopify Admin REST API (2024-10)
  - Shopify Admin GraphQL API (2026-01) for transfers
  - ShopifyQL for sales data
  - Google Drive API for cache storage
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Deployment:** Vercel with Cron Jobs

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Shopify store with Admin API access
- Google Cloud project with OAuth and Service Account credentials
- Google Drive shared drive named "ProjectionsVsActual Cache"

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Fill in your environment variables in `.env`

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## Agent API authentication

Humans continue to sign in with Google OAuth and use the dashboard as before.

AI agents and other machines can call the same operational `/api/*` routes **without** a Google session cookie by sending a server-side API key. Do not reuse `CRON_SECRET` for this.

Set `AGENT_API_KEY` in the server environment only (never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). If the env var is unset or empty, bearer authentication is rejected.

```http
Authorization: Bearer <AGENT_API_KEY>
X-Agent-Name: inventory-bot
```

`X-Agent-Name` is optional and defaults to `Agent`. Writes are attributed as that name with email `agent@inventory.magbak.ai` (Slack, activity logs, `createdBy` / `updatedBy`). A valid agent token has full write access, same as `ALLOWED_EMAILS`.

Call `https://inventory.magbak.ai` (not the `vercel.app` alias) so the `Authorization` header is not dropped by the custom-domain redirect.

`GET /api/inventory` and `GET /api/forecasting` stay unauthenticated cached reads. `/api/cron/refresh` still uses `CRON_SECRET` only.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |

| `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` | Google service account private key |
| `GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID` | Google Cloud project ID |
| `ALLOWED_EMAILS` | Comma-separated list of allowed email addresses |
| `AUTH_SECRET` | NextAuth secret (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`) |
| `AUTH_URL` | Application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Secret for Vercel cron job authentication |
| `AGENT_API_KEY` | Server-only bearer token for AI agents / machines (do not reuse `CRON_SECRET`; never `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) |
